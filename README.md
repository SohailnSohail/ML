This GitHub repository contains multiple projects focused on image compression, data analysis, and machine learning. One project demonstrates compressing images using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and calculating the necessary singular values for effective data reduction. Another project analyzes data characteristics, trains various regression models, and evaluates their performance using metrics like RMSE. Additionally, there's a project on visualizing data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and reducing dimensionality. The repository also includes a matrix decomposition project using SVD and a polynomial linear regression model project with visualization of the prediction results. These projects collectively showcase techniques for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.
